            <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site</h1>
            <p>
              With over a decade of development experience in a number of
              industries I realized that the typical product creation process
              between clients and developers was flawed. All too often
              developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the
              development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to
              reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different
              development pattern that focuses on highly focused communicaion
              and transparent design patterns. when I take on a project not only
              do I work to craft he application according to he client's
              specifications, i give daily updates to ensure that the project is
              aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the
              right product, delivered on time, and on budget.
